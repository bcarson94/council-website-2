          The future of our county depends on our children. Unfortunately, at-risk youth are sent out of county and out of state, separating families and taking our deputies off the road instead of being here for our public safety. It's imperative that we make sure children grow up the right way.

          <br></br>
          The LEAP District project promises great economic reward, but also needs 10-100 Millions Gallons of water per Day from our County. We need to ensure that economic growth is intelligently balanced with conservation that maintains our livelihood, money, and health.

          <br></br>
          Thanks to our vibrant and growing economy, Tippecanoe County has generated substantial tax revenue, enough for both a large Rainy Day Fund and Millions in additional uncommitted dollars. To capitalize on this, we need to create long-term strategic budget planning.

      As a graduate from West Lafayette High School and Purdue University, I have longstanding ties and an unwavering investment in the future of our county for decades to come.  <b>Tippecanoe needs to build a new generation of leaders that are prepared to keep our county strong,</b> a major part of why I'm running for election in 2024.

      Experience matters, but a fresh perspective and a willingness to learn matters too. Party Politics is better left for CNN and Fox News; in Tippecanoe County, we know how to come together and find common ground on issues that everyone cares about. That's why I'm proud to serve on the <b>West Lafayette Board of Public Works and Safety</b>, why I'm proud to have friends and supporters that are <b>Democrats and Republicans</b>, and why I'm proud to be a volunteer in the <b>Stop The Water Steal organization</b> working to protect our resources and our well-being.

    <p class="text-2xl">
     I've spent many years working in a wide variety of industries, including Teaching, Engineering, Communications, Management, and most recently creating my own business in Education Technology. I believe that I possess a strong skill-set of interdisciplinary knowledge that I can use to find the best ways to tackle challenges our community faces. Throwing money at our problems will never work, nor will looking the other way. <b>We need to use our County Budget in smart, strategic, and accountable ways that helps us prosper.</b>
